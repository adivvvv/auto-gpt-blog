# auto-gpt-blog

Text-only, fast blog that **pulls unique templates + articles** from your feed service.

## What this repo does
- Calls **/template_bundle** to fetch a unique design and writes it into `app/Templates` + `public/assets`.
- Calls **/generate** to fetch articles and stores them to `data/posts/*.json`, keeping an index at `data/posts.json`.
- Serves pages through a small front controller (`public/index.php`).

No build steps, no external fonts, no tracking. Pure PHP + inline CSS.
